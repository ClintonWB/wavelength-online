# wavelength-online

This is an online version of [Wavelength](https://www.wavelength.zone/), an excellent party game by Alex Hague, Justin Vickers, and Wolfgang Warsch. This version was created with their permission. Wavelength was released shortly before the 2020 nationwide lockdowns, and at the time no other way to play it online was avaiable. Since then, an official version has been released, and several other people have released their own takes.

A hosted instance is available at [wavelength.clintonbradford.com](wavelength.clintonbradford.com), this mainly served as a weekend project to learn the basics of containerized deployment to Heroku and the websocket protocol. It also leverages integrated SVG interfaces, in my opinion an underutilized technology.
